# SPOLU alternatives
**Construction of possible intersectional labels between ODS, TOP 09, and KDU-ČSL.**

Three Czech political parties ODS, TOP 09, and KDU-ČSL decided to form a coalition named SPOLU (TOGETHER) for 2021 parliament elections.

It is a convenient and highly symbolic label, since it shares 2 letters with ODS (right-center) and TOP (right-liberal) and 3 letters with KDUČSL (Christian democrats).

The space of possible alternatives is explored using Czech ngram corpus from http://www.pspad.com/cz/download.php#dictionary
